        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p class="logistics-intro">
          <strong>Here’s what you need to know:</strong><br />
          This tour is a 3-day ride through the heart of Wales with 3 overnight
          stays.
          <br /><br /><strong>Bikes</strong> and <strong>luggage</strong> will
          be transported from Belper to the start point and back home to Belper
          from the end point. <strong>Luggage</strong> will be transported
          between each overnight stop. <br /><br />This makes it easier for you
          to arrange your own travel to/from the start/end point and enables you
          to cycle without the burden of carrying luggage.<br /><br />
          We’ll offer guidance on travel options and group travel arrangements.
        </p>
        <p class="logistics-intro">
          <strong>How much will it cost?:</strong><br />
          For three nights accommodation and bike/luggage transport, the
          estimated cost is approximately £350 per person. This is based on a
          maximum group size of 10 riders and assumes shared rooms. Alternative
          room arrangements can be accommodated if preferred.
          <br />
          <br />
          All our tours are designed to make no profit and any surplus funds are
          donated to our designated charity <strong>Rainbows Hospice</strong>.
