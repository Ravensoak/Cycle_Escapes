    <h2>Tours</h2>
    <h3>Non‑Profit Operation Policy</h3>
<p>Cycle Escapes operates all tours on a non‑profit basis in accordance with our founding ethos. Participant contributions are used exclusively to cover essential tour costs, including transportation and accommodation. Any surplus funds remaining after all expenses have been settled will be donated to a nominated charity. This model ensures transparency, delivers strong value for participants, and supports positive community impact.</p>
<h3>Safety and Group Management Policy</h3>
<p>Cycle Escapes is committed to maintaining a safe and supportive riding environment for all participants. Ride leaders are responsible for assessing conditions, managing group dynamics, and making decisions that prioritise rider safety at all times. Participants are expected to follow the instructions of ride leaders, adhere to designated routes, and ride in a manner that supports the safety and wellbeing of the group. Any behaviour that compromises safety may result in a rider being asked to modify their conduct or, in exceptional circumstances, leave the ride.</p>
<h3>Booking and Participation Policy</h3>
<p>Participation in Cycle Escapes tours requires advance booking and timely payment of all associated costs. Bookings are confirmed only once payment has been received in full. Participants are responsible for ensuring they are physically prepared for the planned route and that their bicycle and equipment are in safe, roadworthy condition. Cycle Escapes reserves the right to decline participation if safety, fitness, or equipment concerns are identified.</p>
<h3>Governance and Decision‑Making Policy</h3>
<p>Cycle Escapes operates under a collaborative governance model in which key decisions regarding routes, safety measures, charitable donations, and operational practices are made by the organising team. Ride leaders are empowered to make real‑time decisions during tours to ensure safety and smooth operation. All policies are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain aligned with our ethos, legal requirements, and the best interests of participants.</p>
<h3>Cancellation Terms Policy</h3>
<p>Cancellations must be communicated to Cycle Escapes as early as possible to allow for appropriate adjustments to tour arrangements. Participant payments are used to secure accommodation, transportation, and other non‑refundable services; therefore, refunds cannot be guaranteed. Where costs have not yet been incurred, Cycle Escapes will make every reasonable effort to return the corresponding portion of the participant’s payment. If a participant withdraws after non‑refundable expenses have been committed, their payment may be retained to cover those costs. In the event that Cycle Escapes must cancel a tour, all participants will receive a full refund of any payments made. Any surplus funds arising from cancellations will be donated to the nominated charity in line with our non‑profit operating model.
</p>
<h3>Equipment Standards Policy</h3>
<p>All participants are responsible for ensuring that their bicycle and associated equipment are safe, roadworthy, and suitable for the planned route. This includes, but is not limited to, functioning brakes, appropriate gearing, correctly inflated tyres, and adequate lighting where required. Riders must carry essential spares such as inner tubes and basic tools to address minor mechanical issues during the tour. Cycle Escapes reserves the right to decline participation if a rider’s equipment is deemed unsafe or unsuitable, in order to protect the safety and wellbeing of the wider group.
</p>
<h3>Data Protection Policy</h3>
<p>Cycle Escapes is committed to safeguarding the personal information of all participants. Only the minimum data necessary for tour administration, safety management, and essential communication will be collected. Personal information will be stored securely, accessed only by authorised organisers, and retained only for as long as required to fulfil operational and legal obligations. Data will never be shared with third parties except where required for accommodation, transportation, or other essential tour logistics. Participants may request access to, or deletion of, their personal information in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.
</p>
<h3>Code of Conduct Policy</h3>
<p>Participants are expected to uphold respectful, considerate, and cooperative behaviour throughout all Cycle Escapes activities. This includes following the instructions of ride leaders, maintaining group cohesion, and treating fellow riders, local communities, and the environment with courtesy. Behaviour that endangers others, disrupts the group, or undermines the ethos of Cycle Escapes will not be tolerated. Ride leaders reserve the right to intervene, including asking a participant to modify their behaviour or, in exceptional cases, withdraw from the tour.

    <h2>Rider Support</h2>
    <h3>Support Vehicle and Transport Policy</h3>
<p>Cycle Escapes provides a designated support vehicle to assist with the safe and efficient transport of bicycles, luggage, and rider needs throughout the tour. Participants must ensure that their bicycles and luggage are delivered to the specified loading point to allow sufficient time for secure loading and transport to the first overnight location. At the conclusion of the tour, participants must be present at the designated loading point for return transport. Exact loading locations will be confirmed closer to the tour date.
The support vehicle will transport all luggage between overnight stops, enabling participants to ride without carrying additional weight. The vehicle will also remain on‑call to provide mechanical assistance or rider pick‑up if required. This system ensures that all participants have access to timely support and can complete each day’s route safely and comfortably.

    <h2>Rides</h2>
    <h3>Group Riding Policy</h3>
<p>Wherever practical, all participants will ride together as a single group. In circumstances where differing abilities or safety considerations require it, the ride leaders may divide participants into smaller ability‑based groups at their discretion. A buddy system will be implemented for all rides: each rider will be paired with another rider and will remain responsible for maintaining awareness of their buddy’s location and wellbeing throughout the route. This system ensures that no rider is left isolated in the event of a mechanical issue, delay, or other unforeseen incident.

    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <h3>Travel Arrangements Policy</h3>
<p>Participants are responsible for organising and funding their own travel to and from the designated start and finish points of the tour. Cycle Escapes will provide suggested travel options in advance and will assist with coordinating shared travel arrangements where feasible. All riders are expected to arrive at the start and finish locations at the agreed times to ensure smooth tour operations.
