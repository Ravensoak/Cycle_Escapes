          <p>
            A very scenic tour starting in Llanelli on the coast in South Wales,
            skirting the Brecon Beacons and the Elan Valley, through the heart
            of Wales and Snowdonia to finish in Conwy on the North Wales coast.
            Using country lanes and well paved cycle paths, some parts of this
            route are challenging, but with stunning views and rewarding stops
            along the way.

          <p>
            A circular route starting and ending near Edinburgh, passing through

            <li>
              <strong>Day 1 - Champany to Stirling:</strong>
              The ride started by visiting the 3 bridge viewpoint in Queensferry
              before crossing the Forth road bridge and riding the shoreline of
              the Firth Estuary making use of cycle paths through Dunfermline to
              Stirling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Day 2 - Stirling to Glasgow:</strong>
              The route headed to Balloch on the shores of Loch Lomond, where
              some riders chose the detour to cross by ferry from Balmaha to
              Luss, before continuing along cycle paths beside the River Leven
              to Dumbarton, then turning east into Glasgow to follow the River
              Clyde.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Day 3 - Glasgow to Champany:</strong>
              The return to Champany traced quiet cycle paths and a sweeping
              stretch beside the Forth and Clyde Canal, with opportunities to
              pause at the Falkirk Wheel, admire the Kelpies, and explore the
              historic Blackness Castle along the way.
