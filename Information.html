            <h3>Non-Profit Operation Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes operates all tours on a non-profit basis in
              accordance with our founding ethos. Participant contributions are
              used exclusively to cover essential tour costs, including
              transportation and accommodation. Any surplus funds remaining
              after all expenses have been settled will be donated to a
              nominated charity. This model ensures transparency, delivers
              strong value for participants, and supports positive community
              impact.
            </p>

            <h3>Safety and Group Management</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes is committed to maintaining a safe and supportive
              riding environment for all participants. Ride leaders are
              responsible for assessing conditions, managing group dynamics, and
              making decisions that prioritise rider safety at all times.
              Participants are expected to follow the instructions of ride
              leaders, adhere to designated routes, and ride in a manner that
              supports the safety and wellbeing of the group. Any behaviour that
              compromises safety may result in a rider being asked to modify
              their conduct or, in exceptional circumstances, leave the ride.
            </p>

            <h3>Booking and Participation</h3>
            <p>
              Participation in Cycle Escapes tours requires advance booking and
              timely payment of all associated costs. Bookings are confirmed
              only once payment has been received in full. Participants are
              responsible for ensuring they are physically prepared for the
              planned route and that their bicycle and equipment are in safe,
              roadworthy condition. Cycle Escapes reserves the right to decline
              participation if safety, fitness, or equipment concerns are
              identified.
            </p>

            <h3>Governance and Decision-Making</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes operates under a collaborative governance model in
              which key decisions regarding routes, safety measures, charitable
              donations, and operational practices are made by the organising
              team. Ride leaders are empowered to make real-time decisions
              during tours to ensure safety and smooth operation. All policies
              are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain aligned with our
              ethos, legal requirements, and the best interests of participants.
            </p>

            <h3>Cancellation Terms</h3>
            <p>
              Cancellations must be communicated to Cycle Escapes as early as
              possible to allow for appropriate adjustments to tour
              arrangements. Participant payments are used to secure
              accommodation, transportation, and other non-refundable services;
              therefore, refunds cannot be guaranteed. Where costs have not yet
              been incurred, Cycle Escapes will make every reasonable effort to
              return the corresponding portion of the participant’s payment. If
              a participant withdraws after non-refundable expenses have been
              committed, their payment may be retained to cover those costs. In
              the event that Cycle Escapes must cancel a tour, all participants
              will receive a full refund of any payments made. Any surplus funds
              arising from cancellations will be donated to the nominated
              charity in line with our non-profit operating model.
            </p>

            <h3>Equipment Standards</h3>
            <p>
              All participants are responsible for ensuring that their bicycle
              and associated equipment are safe, roadworthy, and suitable for
              the planned route. This includes, but is not limited to,
              functioning brakes, appropriate gearing, correctly inflated tyres,
              and adequate lighting where required. Riders must carry essential
              spares such as inner tubes and basic tools to address minor
              mechanical issues during the tour. Cycle Escapes reserves the
              right to decline participation if a rider’s equipment is deemed
              unsafe or unsuitable, in order to protect the safety and wellbeing
              of the wider group.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes is committed to safeguarding the personal
              information of all participants. Only the minimum data necessary
              for tour administration, safety management, and essential
              communication will be collected. Personal information will be
              stored securely, accessed only by authorised organisers, and
              retained only for as long as required to fulfil operational and
              legal obligations. Data will never be shared with third parties
              except where required for accommodation, transportation, or other
              essential tour logistics. Participants may request access to, or
              deletion of, their personal information in accordance with
              applicable data protection regulations.
            </p>

            <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
            <p>
              Participants are expected to uphold respectful, considerate, and
              cooperative behaviour throughout all Cycle Escapes activities.
              This includes following the instructions of ride leaders,
              maintaining group cohesion, and treating fellow riders, local
              communities, and the environment with courtesy. Behaviour that
              endangers others, disrupts the group, or undermines the ethos of
              Cycle Escapes will not be tolerated. Ride leaders reserve the
              right to intervene, including asking a participant to modify their
              behaviour or, in exceptional cases, withdraw from the tour.

          <div class="tab-content" id="rider_support">
            <h2 class="heading-underline">Rider Support</h2>

            <h3>Support Vehicle and Transport</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes provides a designated support vehicle to assist with
              the safe and efficient transport of bicycles, luggage, and rider
              needs throughout the tou r. Participants must ensure that their
              bicycles and luggage are delivered to the specified loading point
              to allow sufficient time for secure loading and transport to the
              first overnight location. At the conclusion of the tour,
              participants must be present at the designated loading point for
              return transport. Exact loading locations will be confirmed closer
              to the tour date.
            </p>
            <p>
              The support vehicle will transport all luggage between overnight
              stops, enabling participants to ride without carrying additional
              weight. The vehicle will also remain on-call to provide mechanical
              assistance or rider pick-up if required. This system ensures that
              all participants have access to timely support and can complete
              each day’s route safely and comfortably.
            </p>

          <!-- RIDES -->
          <div class="tab-content" id="rides">
            <h2 class="heading-underline">Rides</h2>

            <h3>Group Riding</h3>
            <p>
              Wherever practical, all participants will ride together as a
              single group. In circumstances where differing abilities or safety
              considerations require it, the ride leaders may divide
              participants into smaller ability-based groups at their
              discretion. A buddy system will be implemented for all rides: each
              rider will be paired with another rider and will remain
              responsible for maintaining awareness of their buddy’s location
              and wellbeing throughout the route. This system ensures that no
              rider is left isolated in the event of a mechanical issue, delay,
              or other unforeseen incident.
            </p>

            <h3>Travel Arrangements</h3>
            <p>
              Participants are responsible for organising and funding their own
              travel to and from the designated start and finish points of the
              tour. Cycle Escapes will provide suggested travel options in
              advance and will assist with coordinating shared travel
              arrangements where feasible. All riders are expected to arrive at
              the start and finish locations at the agreed times to ensure
              smooth tour operations.
