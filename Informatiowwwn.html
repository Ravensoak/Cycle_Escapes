            <h3>Non-Profit Operation Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes operates all tours on a non-profit basis in
              accordance with our founding ethos. Participant contributions are
              used exclusively to cover essential tour costs, including
              transportation and accommodation. Any surplus funds remaining
              after all expenses have been settled will be donated to a
              nominated charity. This model ensures transparency, delivers
              strong value for participants, and supports positive community
              impact.
            </p>

            <h3>Safety and Group Management Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes is committed to maintaining a safe and supportive
              riding environment for all participants. Ride leaders are
              responsible for assessing conditions, managing group dynamics, and
              making decisions that prioritise rider safety at all times.
              Participants are expected to follow the instructions of ride
              leaders, adhere to designated routes, and ride in a manner that
              supports the safety and wellbeing of the group.
            </p>

            <h3>Booking and Participation Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Participation requires advance booking and full payment. Riders
              are responsible for ensuring they are physically prepared and that
              their bicycle and equipment are safe and roadworthy. Cycle Escapes
              reserves the right to decline participation where safety, fitness,
              or equipment concerns exist.
            </p>

            <h3>Governance and Decision-Making Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Cycle Escapes operates under a collaborative governance model.
              Ride leaders may make real-time decisions during tours to ensure
              safety and smooth operation. Policies are reviewed periodically to
              ensure alignment with our ethos and legal requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>Cancellation Terms Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Cancellations must be communicated as early as possible.
              Participant payments are used to secure non-refundable services,
              therefore refunds cannot be guaranteed. Where costs have not yet
              been incurred, reasonable efforts will be made to return the
              corresponding portion. If Cycle Escapes cancels a tour, a full
              refund will be provided.
            </p>

            <h3>Equipment Standards Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Riders must ensure their bicycle and equipment are safe and
              suitable for the route, including functioning brakes, appropriate
              tyres, and essential spares and tools. Participation may be
              declined if equipment is deemed unsafe.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Protection Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Only necessary personal data will be collected for administration,
              safety, and communication. Information will be stored securely,
              accessed only by organisers, and retained only as long as
              required. Data will not be shared except where essential for tour
              logistics.
            </p>

            <h3>Code of Conduct Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Participants are expected to behave respectfully and
              cooperatively, follow ride leader instructions, and support group
              cohesion. Behaviour that compromises safety or the ethos of Cycle
              Escapes may result in intervention or withdrawal from the tour.

            <h3>Support Vehicle and Transport Policy</h3>
            <p>
              A designated support vehicle will transport luggage between
              overnight stops and provide mechanical assistance or rider pick-up
              if required. Participants must deliver bicycles and luggage to the
              specified loading point and be present for return transport at the
              end of the tour.

            <h3>Group Riding Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Where practical, riders will travel as a single group. Ride
              leaders may divide participants into smaller ability-based groups
              if required. A buddy system ensures no rider is left isolated in
              the event of a delay or mechanical issue.

              Participants are responsible for arranging their own travel to and
              from the start and finish points. Suggested options may be
              provided, and shared travel coordination will be supported where
              feasible.
